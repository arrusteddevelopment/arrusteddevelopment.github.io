Hi. I'm Tom. I wanted to learn Rust because the crab seemed cute and now I write in it everyday. I made this site for people who want to learn Rust by actually "building" things and learning the technical details along the way: no fluff, no overly dry documentation, and, most imporantly of all, NO TO-DO APPS.

My ideal audience is those who know the basics of Rust and want to start building in it. For those who haven't already, I'd recommend reading the first few chapters of [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and then coming back here to start seeing how you can build with it. My first post also covers some additional resources I've found to be super helpful in gaining a deeper understanding, so be sure to check that out to see more. 

With that out of the way, let's get to the fun stuff.
