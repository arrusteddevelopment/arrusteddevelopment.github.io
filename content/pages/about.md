Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Tom, the creator of Arrusted Development â€” a hub for engineers who arenâ€™t just satisfied using technology, but who want to really understand it.

I'm a backend engineer with years of experience building web applications at startups, but deep down, Iâ€™ve always craved something more: a real understanding of the systems that power everything we build. After working through tutorial hell and one too many TODO app examples, I decided to create the kind of resource I wish I had â€” one focused on real-world systems, systems programming, and first-principles thinking.

At Arrusted Development, the goal is simple: to make low-level, complex concepts like networking, databases, operating systems, and compilers accessible and fun. While Rust is our main playground ðŸ¦€, we also dive into C, Go, and Node.js/Deno, with a focus on building actual tools â€” not just syntax demos.

If you've ever found yourself wondering:
"How does this actually work under the hood?"
â€” you're in the right place.

I believe systems programming shouldnâ€™t feel intimidating. Through practical projects, deep dives, and a touch of lightheartedness, I'm here to help you move beyond surface-level knowledge and into the guts of real-world software â€” one byte-sized lesson at a time. ðŸ§ âœ¨

Welcome aboard!
