Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Tom, the creator of Arrusted Development â€” a hub for engineers who arenâ€™t just satisfied using technology, but who want to really understand it. I'm glad you stopped by!

I'm a backend engineer with years of experience building web applications at startups and I've always had a desire to really understand at a deeper level the systems that power everything we build. After working through tutorial hell and one too many TODO app examples, I decided I wanted to create the kind of resource I wish I had from the beginning â€” one focused on real-world systems, systems programming, and first-principles thinking.

My goal with this blog is to try and make low-level, complex concepts like networking, databases, operating systems, and compilers accessible and fun. While Rust is our main playground ðŸ¦€, I'll dive into other languages I enjoy working with like C, Go, and Node.js/Deno, with an emphasis on building ACTUALLY useful tools â€” not just syntax demos.

If you've ever found yourself wondering:
"How does this actually work under the hood?"
"I've learned the Rust syntax, now how do I actually build something?"
â€” you're in the right place.

I believe systems programming shouldnâ€™t feel intimidating. Through practical projects, deep dives, and a touch of lightheartedness, I'm here to help you move beyond surface-level knowledge and into the guts of real-world software â€” one byte-sized lesson at a time. ðŸ§ âœ¨

Welcome aboard!
